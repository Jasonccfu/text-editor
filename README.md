## Description

Welcome to my text editor web application!

This app allows you to write and save your content with IndexedDB, making it easily accessible even after closing the application. The application uses next-gen JavaScript and is bundled with webpack plugins, generating an HTML file, a service worker, and a manifest file.

To get started, simply open the application in your text editor and you will see a client server folder structure. You can run npm run start from the root directory to start up the backend and serve the client. Once you run the webpack plugins, you can run the text editor application from your terminal and start writing!

If you want to download the web application, simply click on the Install button and it will be downloaded as an icon on your desktop. The app also has a registered service worker using workbox, which pre-caches your static assets upon loading, making it faster to load and use.

Finally, if you decide to deploy the app to Heroku, it has proper build scripts for a webpack application, ensuring a smooth deployment process.

Enjoy using my text editor web application!
